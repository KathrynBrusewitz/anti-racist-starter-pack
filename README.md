# Anti-Racist Starter Pack Website

This project contains source files for the ARSP site: https://antiraciststarterpack.com/

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). To begin development:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the app: `npm start`

### Other Scripts

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

`npm run eject`

Removes the single build dependency from the project and copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into the project as dependencies in `package.json`. Technically, the distinction between dependencies and development dependencies is pretty arbitrary for front-end apps that produce static bundles.
